## Product Demand Prediction for Inventory Management in an Indian Restaurant

### Overview
This project analyzes online order data from a Indian restaurant in order to classify which product combinations (frequent baskets of items) are most common.  
Using **Apriori algorithms for frequent itemset mining**, feature engineering, and machine learning, the system predicts which products are likely to be ordered during the next three days.  
The objective is to support **inventory management decisions** by anticipating short-term demand patterns.

### Main Components
- Data collection from multiple sources and interfaces  
- Creation of a unified flat table using SQL  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): examining distributions and correlations between variables, removing irrelevant or duplicate records, handling missing values and outliers, and performing statistical tests in R to validate relationships and significance between features
- Feature engineering to derive meaningful predictors  
- Model development and comparison: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and AdaBoost  
- Hyperparameter tuning and model calibration  
- Evaluation of model performance on test data  
- Outline for practical deployment and operational use
